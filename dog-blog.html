    <h1>A Doggos Life</h1>
    <p>by: Indy brown dog</p>
    <h2>Deep Thoughts:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Why do all the godo sticks have to be in the trees...?</li>
      <li>I wonder if I will eat soon...?</li>
      <li>If that neighbors damn cat comes in my yard one more time... I'm gonna play with it.</li>
      <li>Have you ever thought why we all exist and what's the point of it SQUIRREL! I SAW A SQUIRREL!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>My MOST favoritest people, in order:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Dad, he takes me on walks.</li>
      <li>Mom, she lets me help dig in the garden. At least I think I am helping.</li>
      <li>Jordan, he secretly feeds me what he's eating and it is usually cheese!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Ya know, it's pretty darn great being a dog and all i gotta be is fetch a stick and tell people when i gotta... ya know, go potty. WOOF!</p>
